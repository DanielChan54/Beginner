Hello!

My name is Daniel Chan.

I enrolled in Charlotte Chaze's Break Into Tech program to learn Data Analytics and to earn a role in this field.

This portfolio marks the beginning of my Data Analytics learning journey.

It serves as a record of my learning progress and to show you what I'm capable of accomplishing in the Data Analytics field.
